This course will develop the basic science behind the predictions for Earth\u2019s climate, and explain why human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases, are the main driver of global warming. Course topics include the causes of climate change, its impacts, projections for the future, possible mitigation, and economic barriers imposed by the global capitalist system. 3 hours lecture per week. Students receive credit for only one course chosen from either SCI 111, GEOG 111, or SUST 111. (Available for General Education, B1 Physical Science. Students may satisfy the B3 Science Laboratory Activity requirement by completing SCI 111L.)",
