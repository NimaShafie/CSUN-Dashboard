    "prog-reqq-blob": "Program Requirements\nThere are special requirements for admission to the major. Undergraduate instruction is divided between a Pre-Clinical and a Clinical Phase. There are no preadmission requirements for the department\u2019s Pre-Clinical Phase. All entering undergraduate and post-baccalaureate undeclared majors are regarded as Pre-Clinical Phase students. Once junior level or higher academic standing is achieved, Pre-Clinical Phase students must complete CD 405, CD 410, CD 415 and CD 442 or the equivalent and subsequently established themselves as \u201cEligible for Clinical Privileges\u201d at the CSUN Language, Speech and Hearing Center as part of the Clinical Phase of instruction. Course equivalents for CD 405, 410, 415 and 442 must be submitted for review and approval by a faculty advisor and the department chair. Application established oneself as \u201cEligible for Clinical Privileges\u201d is made during the semester in which the Pre-Clinical Phase courses are in progress of completion.\nPlease note that satisfactory completion of Pre-Clinical Phase courses includes a grade of \u201cB\u201d or better in each of the four classes. Enrollment in clinical courses (e.g., CD 465, CD 475 or CD 469O) is not permitted without department approval of being \u201cEligible for Clinical Privileges.\u201d Evaluation for admission to Clinical Privileges includes a faculty assessment of academic and clinical potential, passing of a criminal background check, academic transcripts and satisfactory completion of the Pre-Clinical Phase courses.\nOnce identified as being \u201cEligible for Clinical Privileges,\u201d the student is regarded as a Clinical Phase student and should consult an academic advisor regarding the area of major emphasis (undergraduate Speech-Language Pathology, undergraduate Audiology or post-baccalaureate undeclared majors emphasizing Speech-Language Pathology), proper course sequencing and prerequisites for advanced courses. Each Clinical Phase student maintains Clinical Privileges by (a) earning a grade of \u201cB\u201d or better in each clinical course; (b) complying with the policies and rules of the CSUN Language, Speech and Hearing Center; (c) complying with the applicable laws and regulations of the California Board of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology; (d) observing the ASHA Code of Ethics; and (e) maintaining good academic standing (as defined by the University).\nIf a student is identified as being \u201cIneligible for Clinical Privileges,\u201d or if such privileges have been suspended or revoked, it is possible to complete the baccalaureate degree as a nonclinical major by substitution for all client-contact courses.\nInstructions, due dates and application forms for Clinical Privileges are available in the department office. Clinical Phase students are advised that Clinical Privileges may be suspended or revoked at any time by the department for failure to attain a grade of \u201cB\u201d or better in all clinical courses (e.g., CD 465 et seq., 475 et seq., 469O, 668 and 672AB), for violations of ethical conduct or state licensure regarding client care, for academic notice (formerly academic probation) beyond one semester, or for failure to adhere to the regulations and policies of the CSUN Language, Speech and Hearing Center or of the department.
