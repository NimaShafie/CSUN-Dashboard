    "name": "B.S., Engineering Management Technology",
    "prog-reqq-blob": "Program Requirements\nThe Engineering Management Technology program is based on an expectation of adequate high school preparation in science, mathematics and English. Science courses should include chemistry or physics, both of which are desirable. High school mathematics courses should include algebra and plane geometry. Four years of English are required.\nCSUN provides the opportunity for students who have not had a complete background of pre-engineering work in high school to take courses to prepare for the major. These additional courses will not count toward the major and may increase the time to graduate.\nThe Bachelor\u2019s degree in Engineering Management Technology will provide a firm technical base for students by requiring them to take courses with topics in materials engineering, engineering CAD, quality engineering, systems engineering, facilities planning and design, as well as technical innovation and entrepreneurship. Their technical skills are complemented by business skills in production planning, project management, engineering economy, marketing management and operations research.\nSpecial Grade Requirements\nAll students must complete the lower division writing requirement before enrolling in 300-level courses.\nGrade of \u201cC-\u201d or better is required in all courses in the major. A grade of \u201cC\u201d or better is required in all undergraduate transfer courses.\nSenior-level courses cannot be taken unless the student previously completed or is concurrently completing all freshman-, sophomore- and junior-level core requirements.\nUnit Requirements\nThe following unit requirements are necessary for the B.S. degree in Engineering Management Technology:\n1.
