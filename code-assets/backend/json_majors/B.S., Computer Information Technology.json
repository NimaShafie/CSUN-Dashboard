Domain Emphasis Package (15-18 units)\nComputer Information Technology is pervasive and its use is found throughout nearly all areas of human endeavor. A major objective of the B.S. CIT program is to prepare graduates to work effectively with individuals from other disciplines and to apply information technology (IT) to these disciplines. To this end, students in the B.S. CIT program are required to engage in an in-depth study of some subject that uses computing in a substantive way and that emphasizes collaboration and communication with other individuals.\nThis requirement can be satisfied by completion of one of the following:\nCompletion of an appropriate minor at CSUN that does not include courses offered by the Department of Computer Science or the Department of Systems and Operations Management. The intent of the minor is to focus studies in an application domain in which the graduate plans to start a career. Students interested in focusing their studies on business are advised to explore the Information Systems degree options offered by the Department of Systems and Operations Management. A minor must consist of at least 18 units, but some requirements in a minor might also be applied toward meeting General Education requirements.\nCompletion of a cohesive set of classes, called the Domain Emphasis Package, determined though consultation with the student\u2019s faculty advisor and requiring approval by the department chair prior to enrollment in any course contained in the package. This package should focus on a specific IT or application domain. Such a package shall consist of 15 units, with no more than 6 units of lower division classes chosen strategically to meet the prerequisites of the other classes also included in the package.\nBy the time COMP 110/L is completed, B.S. CIT majors must meet with a faculty advisor to determine the classes in a customized domain emphasis package or to select a minor to fulfill the Domain Emphasis requirement.\n5. General Education (48 units)\nUndergraduate students must complete 48 units of General Education as described in this Catalog, including 3 units of coursework meeting the Ethnic Studies (ES) graduation requirement.\n18 units are satisfied by coursework in the major. Completion of the Computer Information Technology major satisfies A3 Critical Thinking. 6 units of Physical Science or Life Science may be used to satisfy sections B1-3. MATH 103 or MATH 150A or MATH 255A satisfies Basic Skills B4 Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning; CIT 360/L satisfies B5 Scientific Inquiry and Quantitative Reasoning; and COMP 110/L satisfies E Lifelong Learning.\nTotal Units in the Major: 86-94\nGeneral Education Units: 30\nAdditional Units: 0-4\nTotal Units Required for the B.S. Degree: 120-124",
