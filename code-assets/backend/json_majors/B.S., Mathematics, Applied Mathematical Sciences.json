Students in B.A. degree programs must fulfill the University requirement of at least 40 units of upper division coursework overall.\nIt is assumed that the student has a facility in mathematics normally gained by recent completion of four years of high school mathematics through trigonometry and \u201cMathematical Analysis.\u201d Because of the variation in curricula at the high school level, it is necessary to obtain satisfactory scores on the Mathematics Placement Test (MPT) to enter the first mathematics course in the program, MATH 150A. Without satisfactory scores, a student will need to complete additional coursework.\n1. Lower Division Core for All Programs (24 units)\nCOMP 110/L Introduction to Algorithms and Programming and Lab (3/1)\nMATH 150A Calculus I (5)\nMATH 150B Calculus II (5)\nMATH 250 Calculus III (3)\nMATH 262 Introduction to Linear Algebra (3)\nPHYS 220A Mechanics (3)\nPHYS 220AL Mechanics Lab (1)\nStudents must complete the lower division core and one of the Mathematics options, and they must have at least a 2.0 GPA for all upper division units required in the major.\n2. Upper Division Required Courses (21 units)\nMATH 320 Foundations of Higher Mathematics (3)\nMATH 340 Introductory Probability (3)\nMATH 351 Differential Equations (3)\nMATH 382/L Introduction to Scientific Computing and Lab (2/1)\nMATH 450A Advanced Calculus I (3)\nMATH 462 Advanced Linear Algebra (3)\nMATH 480 Partial Differential Equations (3)\n3. Upper Division Electives (18 units)\nChoose (with an advisor) 18 units from among (1) all upper division Math courses (excluding MATH 310, 310L, 311, 312, 331, 391 and 490); and (2) approved courses in other departments. At least 12 units must be in Mathematics. Students are encouraged to take courses outside the Mathematics department, especially upper division courses in the sciences, engineering and economics. All courses must have the approval of an advisor prior to enrollment. Students in this option must meet with an advisor in their junior year and file a program form outlining the planned coursework with the Mathematics department.\n4. General Education (48 units)\nUndergraduate students must complete 48 units of General Education as described in this Catalog, including 3 units of coursework meeting the Ethnic Studies (ES) graduation requirement.\n12 units are satisfied by the following courses in the major: PHYS 220A satisfies B1 Physical Science; PHYS 220AL satisfies B3 Science Laboratory Activity; MATH 150A satisfies Basic Skills B4 Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning; MATH 320 satisfies B5 Scientific Inquiry and Quantitative Reasoning; and COMP 110/L satisfies E Lifelong Learning.\nTotal Units in the Major/Option: 63\nGeneral Education Units: 36\nAdditional Units: 21\nTotal Units Required for the B.S.
